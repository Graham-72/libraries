; This is an example info file for a library used for testing purposes. It
; contains no actual library information, but, since it is named example.info,
; if Libraries API detects a library named 'example', we know that this file was
; properly detected.

; Because the packager on Drupal.org automatically pads this file with project
; information (because it thinks it is a module), we need to hide it from the
; modules page to prevent errors and confusion.
